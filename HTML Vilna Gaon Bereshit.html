<p> Parshat Bereshit</P>
<p> וַיֹּ֥אמֶר קַ֖יִן אֶל־הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑יו

And Cain said to Hevel brother

- Bereshit 4:8 </p>

<p> The Vilna Gaon, Kol Eliyahu (Bereshit 7), Comments: </p>

<p> The Pasuk simply states, “וַיֹּ֥אמֶר קַ֖יִן אֶל־הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑יו” but we do not know what Cain actually said.

We can explain the verse as follows.  Our Sages state that Hevel was physically stronger than Cain (Bereshit Rabbah, Chapter 22). If Cain wrestled with Hevel, on equal terms, he would never win. Cain, therefore, deceptively called out to Hevel, “Brother” “Brother” so that he would not guard himself nor expect anything.  This is what the verse means, “וַיֹּ֥אמֶר קַ֖יִן אֶל־הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑יו  - And Cain said to Hevel, 'Brother'” – deceptively pretending as if he wanted to lovingly speak to his brother.  Cain planned this “when they were in the field” far from their parents.  “Cain rose up against Hevel [his] brother and killed him.” </p>

<p> Question: </p>


<p> The Vilna Gaon understands Cain as committing premeditated murder.   What prompted Cain to commit such a sin? </p> 

<p>Possible Answer:</p> 

<p>The Torah states,
	
    ...And G-d paid heed to Hevel and his offering.  But Cain and his offering were paid no heed.  Cain was greatly distressed, and his face fell (Bereshit 4:4-5)
    
    In Aderet Eliyahu, the Vilna Gaon explains that “Cain was greatly distressed” because he did not understand his mistake.  He did not understand why G-d rejected his offering.  
    
    The Gaon interprets “his face fell” differently.  The Gra explains that “his face fell” meaning that Cain compared himself to his brother.  Seeing his brother’s offering accepted and not his, he became embarrassed.  The Gaon offers another interpretation: Cain felt his intentions rebuffed.  Cain intended to gain G-d’s favor with his flax offering but was rejected instead.   Considering himself punished for a good deed, Cain felt as though “לית דין ולית דיין ולית משגיח ח"ו – there was no justice, judge, or ruler in the world (G-d forbid).”   He felt as though G-d hated him for no reason whereas his brother was unconditionally loved.  In this state of crisis, embarrassment, and jealousy, Cain tried to remove the source of his suffering.
