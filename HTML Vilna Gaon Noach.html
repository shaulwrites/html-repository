<p>Parshat Noach </p>

<p> וַיֵּ֥שְׁתְּ מִן־הַיַּ֖יִן וַיִּשְׁכָּ֑ר וַיִּתְגַּ֖ל בְּת֥וֹךְ אׇהֳלֹֽה

He [Noach] drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself within his tent.

- Bereshit 9:21 </p>

<p> The Vilna Gaon, in Kol Eliyahu (Parshat Vayera), Comments:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Torah (Bereshit 21:33) states: "וַיִּטַּ֥ע אֶ֖שֶׁל בִּבְאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע - And Avraham planted an אֶ֖שֶׁל [a tree] in Ber Sheva.”  The Midrash on Tehillim  states that the letters of אֶ֖שֶׁל  stands for אכילה שתיה לויה – feeding guests, giving them to drink, and escorting them.  Avraham's intended to correct the sins of generations past.  In feeding guests, Avraham corrected the sin of Adam. In giving his guests drinks, Avraham corrected the sin of Noach.  In escorting his guests, Avraham corrected the sin of Sodom.</p>

<p> Question: </p>


<p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike Adam  and the people of Sodom,  the Torah never explicitly states that Noach sinned.  What sin, if any, did Noach commit?  How did Avraham, in giving his guests drinks, correct Noach's mistake? </p> 

<p>Possible Answer:</p> 

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch explains that once Noach realized that “the wine was going to his head, he took refuge in the innermost part of the tent (וַיִּתְגַּ֖ל בְּת֥וֹךְ אׇהֳלֹֽה) - where he hoped nobody would see him.”  Even in his drunken state, Noach tried to preserve his privacy, hoping “to be kept away from being seen by his sons, who were not to see him in the condition he was in.”   Noach's mistakenly drank too much  and needed to react modestly and hide. Avraham, on the other hand, takes precautionary measures to prevent immodesty in the first place.  His wife, Sarah, modestly makes bread in her tent  while Avraham gives guests' milk.   Since he prepares for these potential obstacles in advance, Avraham can invite guests and still maintain privacy.  While Noach – though righteously – reacts, Avraham proactively prepares. </p>
